|summary|requested support of IfcEllipse for profile definitions| 


## Description
Ellipses are supported for export/import of profile geometry as used in the definition of building elements or openings. There is no requirement for maintaining ellipse definitions for re-export (no roundtrip guarantee). An imported ellipse may be exported as a faceted polyline or a composite curve based on arc segments.

The following entities to define an ellipse are supported:

* IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef.OuterCurve = IfcEllipse
* IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef.OuterCurve = IfcCompositeCurve with segments based on IfcEllipse
** same for IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDefWithVoids.InnerCurves
*IfcEllipseProfileDef
 

Beside for the support of profile definitions, an ellipse may also be used within an IfcGeometricSet or IfcGeometricCurveSet. Therefore IfcEllipse is also supported as part of a 2D representation of IfcAnnotation

NOTE [2010-03-01]:  Annotations are not part of the Coordination View Version 2.0 scope, but part of a separate Annotation add-on view 

Note ellipse (or elliptical arc) is not supported as an axis for an IfcWallStandardCase
