## Description
The b-splines as definined in IFC

* IfcBezierCurve
* IfcRationalBezierCurve

are not supported by implementations in any case (not in profiles, nor in 2D Geometry).

[added 2008-02-26] It is an error to export a b-spline (being IfcBezierCurve or IfcRationalBezierCurve) as part of an IFC2x3 coordination view exchange file.

[added 2010-03-01] Reconfirmed for Coordination View Version 2.0, b-splines are excluded from scope
