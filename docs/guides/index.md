The IFC **Guides** can help you work with various aspects of the IFC system.

* The IFC [User Guide](#user-guide-internal) can help you read IFC files.
* The [Developer Guide](https://github.com/bigdoods/ifc-tech.org/tree/{{page.githubbranch}}/docs/devel) can help you either write code to directly access IFC, or to contribute directly to the IFC project.
