The IFC **Guides** can help you work with various aspects of IFC standards.

* The [IFC 2x3 model implementation guide](/docs/guides/IFC2x Model Implementation Guide V2-0b.pdf) can help you implement the
IFC standard. It is an extension to the existing IFC literature, particularly the IFC schema specification,
with focus on implementation using STEP implementation technologies.

Please note that the IFC standard has been evolved from many years of work from vendors. As a result, there have been some implementation agreements established by vendors. [This page](/docs/guides/implementerAgreements) entails a complete history of these agreements.
