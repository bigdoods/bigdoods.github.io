title: Implementer Agreements
---

List of implementation agreements established by the official buildingSMART Implementation Group, ISG. Each implementer agreement, once finalized and accepted, becomes a binding agreement for implementing the particular IFC view definition to which the implementer agreement applies.

<i>The following format applies to the reference links found at the link to the implementer agreement reference below: </i>
