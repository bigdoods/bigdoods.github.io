## Troubleshooting

Sometimes things go wrong. This guide is aimed at making them right. It has
two sections:

   * [Troubleshooting your .ifc file as an end-user](/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting) - Useful for users who are using IFC files and wondering why it is not working.
   * [Troubleshooting .ifc as a developer](/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting) - Useful for people using IFC to build new software and tools.

You should also check the known issues for the release you're using. The issue database is used to report issues and to track their resolution in case of issues with a small well-defined scope. The latest issues and IFC discussions take place on the [IFC JIRA channel](http://jira.buildingsmart.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa).
