## Schema

Below you will find links to the schema documentation. The documentation is written according to specification in the EXPRESS data modeling language. Reference specifications are indexed according to the IFC platform release it belongs to.

Documentation reference include EXPRESS and XML reference schema-languages for schema as standard. This is in accordance with ISO specification but other schema-languages can be seen in the Extension references section below.

* [IFC 2](/docs/reference/schema/ifc2x3-tc1/overview.md) - Current Schema for IFC 2. (latest)
* [IFC4](/docs/reference/schema/ifc4_Add2/overview.md) - Current Schema for IFC4 (latest)

## Extension References

The IFC schema have various representations and you can find them below.

* [IFC EXPRESS](/docs/reference/schema-languages/ifc-express/express-overview/) - IFC schema in EXPRESS data modeling language
* [IFC EXPRESS-G](/docs/reference/schema-languages/ifc-express/express-g-overview/) - IFC schema in EXPRESS-G(GRAPHICAL) data modeling language.
* [IFC OWL](/docs/reference/schema-languages/ifc-owl/owl-overview/) - IFC schema to Web Ontology Language.
* [IFC XSD](/docs/reference/schema-languages/ifc-xml-xsd/xml-overview/) - IFC schema in XSD data modeling language

## Subsets

Subsets can be used to create a specific schema that may be suitable for a data exchange edge use-case.

* [IFC MVD](/docs/reference/subset/ifc-mvd/mvd-overview/) - IFC Model-View-Definition demonstrates a subset of the IFC schema

## Data Formats

Single individual models representing buildings can be represented in the following formats.

* [IFC RDF](/docs/reference/data-formats/ifc-rdf/rdf-overview/) - A building representation with semantic detail.
* [IFC SPF](/docs/reference/data-formats/ifc-spf/spf-overview/) - This is the physical file-format, also known as a STEP file.
* [IFC XML](/docs/reference/data-formats/ifc-xml/xml-overview/) - A format designed to be read by machine and human.
