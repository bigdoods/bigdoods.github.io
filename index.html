			<h3>IFC, short for "Industry Foundation Classes", are a data schema enabling the exchange and sharing of relevant data between different software applications in the construction and operation of built facilities. Having the roots back to 1996, the IFC have been continuosly enhanced to support software interoperability for openBIM.</h3>

		<div class="feature-box">
			<div>
				<h4>Data modelling at the semantic level</h4>
				<p>The EXPRESS schema language has rich facilities for data modeling at the semantic level (e.g., an expression sublanguage, semantic constraint mechanisms, aggregate data types [bag, set, list, array] for attribute values, etc).</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>STEP ecosystem </h4>
				<p>STEP (ISO 10303 - Industrial automation systems and integration - Product data representation and exchange) is developed by a specialist group in the International Standards Organisation. They have built many tools(classes) for working with the STEP standard.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="feature-box">
			<div>
				<h4>AP classes</h4>
				<p>IFC progressively makes use of the AP classes developed by the international standards organisation. Take advantage of a growing ecosystem of interoperability solutions.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Good file header management</h4>
				<p>The files have explicit file headers so your software knows what to do with it.</p>
