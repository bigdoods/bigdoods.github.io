			<h3>International User Groups (IUGs)</h3>
			<p> The buildingSMART International User Group (IUG) is a platform for the global openBIM community. We provide information and resources to support construction industry professionals working with buildingSMART standards.
The international user group is the lead body with responsibility to facilitate and enhance collaboration between chapters and engagement of chapters with the standards and compliance programs.

        Have a special interest in how IFC or ecosystem technology could be a solution?  See our ever growing
				<a href="https://github.com/bigdoods/bigdoods.github.com/docs/International-User-Groups-(IUGs)">lists of IUGs</a>,
				from IFC to BCF there's a place for you to contribute and instructions
				for forming a new IUG if your special interest isn't covered (yet).</p>

			<p>As a member of the IFC community, you are welcome to join any of the IUG meetings
				you are interested in. No registration required.</p>
